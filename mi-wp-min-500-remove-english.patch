-Some of these comments could be just as good or better on our general talk page. Anyone who likes can copy to there; but Hau Kāinga is a good page to look at when thinking about these points.
-Some readers may have noticed in my recent page history comment that I was wondering whether page names should include "Te".
-Only one of our articles currently does (te reo Maori); but a great many of the links in Hau Kāinga are looking to create pages starting with "Te". 
-Here are some reasons AGAINST:
- 03:12, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
-Ka pai! Thanks for dropping by and adding to your already long list of contributions. You may notice I already excluded most of the "te" from the links. 11:38, 1 May 2004 (UTC)
-Robin here again. Can someone (preferably the person who composed or translated the heading) explain the meaning - and perhaps the envisaged long-term scope - of "Iwi Whānui" (so that some of us can get a better idea of whether it might be just as good underneath the much bigger box)? It looks a bit small since I moved the stuff that didn't relate to this Māori Wikipedia. 06:38, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)
-E pai ana, e hoa! I had worked out that you probably meant something like that (which means my translation sources must agree with yours). I'm considering moving it too, to go BELOW the specifically NZ material, so that the NZ columns have more room to display and expand. We have such a swag of material there, with scope for much more, and those specifically Maori subjects are what most of our serious visitors will have come to see - not the general Wikipedia links. I would be pleased if you decided to move it there, because you are far more used to tables than I am! 
-Now I hope you and less frequent visitors have a glance at most of the new additions and changes, with a harder look at some of them. Kind regards - 11:38, 1 May 2004 (UTC)
-Hi. I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but you may want to see our new Meta page: List of articles all languages should have. It is intended to give a boost to the smaller languages. Hope it helps. 20:27, 29 May 2004 (UTC)
-Hi, has anyone contacted any of the grassroots organizations yet? Just curious. Though I imagine even a sort of "simple Maori" (i.e. Maori composed using available vocabulary) written by young learners would be useful. 17:02, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)
-I'm not prepared to allow it unless it is replaced in the same edit by better-quality Māori material. 11:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
-Hi Robin, hi node_ue,
-I have reverted the two changes by node_ue.
-1) concerning the position of the English intro: 
-1.1) I firmly believe that it is up to the mi team to decide where to place this invitation for English-speaking people. Unfortunately the majority of ethnic Maoris do not speak their own language well. Besides Maori is official language in New Zealand, and we have to assume that a 
-great number of people from New Zealand with non-Maori background will just come around to have a look. From what I know, at least a bit of Maori is taught to everyone in NZ at school. So node_ue, you do not have to be the language police here. Just leave it up to true Kiwis to decide where to put this. So far I have not seen any complaints about the mi main page, apart from you, who are neither Maori nor Kiwi.
-1.2) While it might be arguable, whether or not the English invitation deserves the first line, I think that it is definitely out of place where node placed it. It is below a longer paragraph in English. I think a good place would be an info box in a right column. But I do not want to 
-interfere with that. Let us just leave that for the Maori team to decide. And node: you and I do not belong to this team. So just leave them in peace.
-2) Concerning the Macron-edit:
-2.1) node, your version has added two links, one to "Haere mai" and one to "Wikipedia". But these two pages do not exist so far. Of course a page about Wikipedia will eventually be written. But we 
-do not know whether the mi team will have a separate page "Haere mai", which (as far as I know) means welcome. So I think it would have been better in this case to wait until such a page exists before it is linked to. 
-2.2) the macron-text was inside a comment, so it is not visible and it did not annoy anyone but the language police. For someone who was blocked for a week here, node, I think that this is not a good restart for you here.
-My proposition to node: before making any further changes in any article, you should propose your changes in a *friendly* way on the corresponding talk page. Otherwise I fear you are in danger of getting a much, much longer blocking here.
-My proposition to Robin: write protect the main page. You have had trouble enough about it. Everyone would still be able to leave comments in the talk page.
-Kia ora. Please remove the link to sep11.wikipedia.org from your main page. It is no longer supposed to be linked to (check 95% of the other Wikipedias, including en:). Thank you. 11:30, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
-Kia ora. Please add the Ido language (io) to the front of the page if you will. Thank you. 
-Does any one agree that the main page needs a redesign? I would have a go at it, but I’m just any ordinary user (need admin access to edit the main page).
-Heoi anō; nā 09:24, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
-Please add latin to the links on the front page. Thank you.
-Please make a Maori version of the logo. 2006-02-05 17:12:08 66.177.138.113
-I looked at - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page_alternate_%28Classic_2004%29 - the en. Wiki main page as of 2004 and realised that that was the basis of our Hau Kāinga page. The headings equivalent to our 'Pukapuka Taki Pātauranga' and 'Iwi Whānui' were 'Encyclopedia' and 'Community.' I retranslated Community, since Iwi Whānui isnt quite right for that. Then I looked up 'Encyclopedia' in various M. dictionaries, and in the Ngata dictionary it is 'Pukapuka Taki Mātauranga'. So that explains where the mystery Pātauranga came from - a typo!!! I retranslated that heading as Mātāpunenga (encyclopedia) in accordance with what we call ourselves. I also replaced the obscure (but in the dictionary) "Kohuku" meaning unfinished with the plainer and more comprehensible 'hei whakaoti' 'to be completed'. 18:35, 14 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)
-Great stuff! Now I wonder whether "Āwhina mai - whakamāoritia!" is the best starter. We seem to have lost the invitation for first-time visitors to browse and LEARN something. A recent version had the heading "Akona" followed by "Hei tauira, titiro koa ki ēnei whārangi papai: ..."; and the sitenotice mentioned the idea of learning too. Most visitors are unlikely to contribute directly but may turn into devotees and ambassadors if they like what they read. 19:33, 19 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)
-Bother! The printed version has a more serious error: the logos for the sister projects float up to near the top of the page (p2) instead of sitting in their boxes. We need an image expert. BrianNZ?? (An alternative could be to put those on another page altogether.) 21:27, 20 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)
-Still crook, folks! When I click for the printable version now, the logos for Ngā pūtere kōpūtahi display floating at the top of the page, so I'm not even going to try printing again. Maybe it's time for Kahuroa's mate to come on board? Or , another image expert? 21:18, 21 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)
-Thank you all for taking an interest. My display is back to how it should be but the actual print of the printable version still floats the dear little beggars to the top of their page. I may try "temporary" solution: Give that section its own page, with links from main (so that our initial presentation is closer to flawless) and portal. 21:15, 22 Hui-tanguru 2006 (UTC)
-The Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia image at the top left of the page should be translated into Māori too. 2006-02-21 09:07:03 203.109.164.4
-Should I try them direct or would you folks like to see them tried elsewhere first? 20:33, 19 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-Done a few little ones. I suppose I could list the bigger ones here for perusal. That will have to wait till lunchtime. 22:34, 19 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-Most or all of the Wikipedia reo kē appear elsewhere on the page. I'd be quite happy to lose all of the ones that don't have the justification of a Maori translation. 01:31, 21 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-I think we could do without the sister projects; some other page, OK, but I see no value in having them on our main page. 01:31, 21 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-I also have plans to remove 70% of the English content: everything starting from "There are at least ..." - that may please some of you! Most of what's virtually repeated on the Tomokanga hapori is unnecessary on the front page. 01:31, 21 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-Good recent reshuffle, Kahuroa. I had been thinking that the Tīmata pēnei was a little premature near the top left, inviting response "start what?" - so your moving it to the other column and renaming is great. I had a feeling there was scope for integrating that para and the following one, but only a fluent speaker could start on that sort of task! 20:25, 23 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-Should the tāone nui be a subsection of Aotearoa? Maybe replace at the bottom with a short "Whenua me tāone o te Ao"? 20:25, 23 Poutū-te-rangi 2006 (UTC)
-That image that just went up is nice, well done! :) Heoi anō; nā 00:25, 9 Paenga-whāwhā 2006 (UTC)
-For better column balance, how about moving "Akona: he whārangi papai hei tauira" to right-hand column? 03:42, 10 Paenga-whāwhā 2006 (UTC)
-Dear Maori Wikipedians, I really enjoyed those revisions, they seemed to give it a more ethnic feel. I particularly liked the english box, as I think that ought to be a lot more ecumenical than the straight Maori look the last one had. Sure hope this place can get more sites. Cheers! Sincerely, 05:38, 23 Haratua 2006 (UTC)
-I think we need to apply some criteria to the pages used as examples etc, especially those cited as "whārangi papai".
-Will be gradually implementing this. 23:10, 4 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)
-Kia ora! I am an administrator from the Macedonian Wiki and I see that you have only some languages listed directly at the bottom of the page and I was wondering if you could put the Macedonian Wiki there as well (in case you don't have some special criteria for that). Should you decide to accept it, the code should look like this: . The original name of the language in the latin alphabet is "Makedonski". I don't know whether you will transliterate it into Māori from the English name or directly from the original. I leave that to you. All best and thanks a lot. Б. Јанкулоски
-("First para copied from what Kahuroa wrote elsewhere.")<br>
-I would like to reformat the page. To do it I need all the articles under 'Awa' or 'X' to be in the category 'Awa' or 'X' and for the Awa catpage or the 'X' catpage to have been created. It's daunting to have to do everything before you can start things. 19:29, 13 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)
-Have not viewed mi for a while. The mainpage looks Kai Pai! 03:13, 16 Pipiri 2006 (UTC)

-Mobile Homer
-
-"Mobile Homer" is the thirteenth episode of "The Simpsons" sixteenth season; it was first broadcast in the US on 20 March, 2005.
-When Marge takes the kids on a Sunday drive, Homer suffers from cleaning the garage at home. He gets spiders in his throat, and he is almost killed by the garage door. Luckily, he gets saved by Lisa (who gives Homer air) and Bart (who compresses Homer's chest). After the incident, Marge insists that the family buy life insurance, but Homer is deemed uninsurable because of his bad medical history. Marge, influenced by a movie about a wealthy man without insurance whose widow and children were forced to live on the streets, decides to save money by buying imitation brands of cereal and coffee. Homer tries to comfort Marge but Marge rejects him and calls him out. Homer, now angry about Marge's new measures, uses the nest egg she made to finance the down payment for a new motor home, although Homer already owned one in the episode "The Call of the Simpsons" (albeit a dilapidated one.) After he buys his motor home, Marge tells him to enjoy it because she never wants to speak to him again.
-Homer starts living in the RV, and he and Marge compete for the loyalty of Bart and Lisa. Fortunately, Homer's kid ways gives him an advantage and wins the kids over. Homer discovers a convoy of RVs at a gas station, and invites them to stay in his backyard. Marge gets annoyed with their behavior and cuts off their electricity, causing Homer's newfound friends to ditch him. Homer and Marge proceed to get into an argument so powerful that lasts all night. Fearing that Homer and Marge might divorce, Bart decides that he and Lisa should return the RV to the dealership. 
-Discovering that the kids and RV are gone, Homer and Marge give chase in the car. Bart and Lisa accidentally get on the freeway, and force their parents to make up. Bart and Lisa then try to pull over, but lose control of the RV, which plunges off an uncompleted runaway truck ramp onto a Turkish container ship. The ship is leaving port, but Marge convinces the captain to turn around after offering him several cans of mushroom soup she bought on sale. With their marriage restored, Homer tells Marge that he'll return the RV in the morning, and uses the ship's crane to put the vehicle on a nearby dock. This collapses, and the RV sinks in the harbor, much to Homer's dismay ("D'OH!"). Marge is unconcerned about the loss of money, because the Turkish sailors put hashish in her food.
