# This file maps orthographic characters to phoneme symbols for the
# purposes of generating a pronunciation model.
#

# Empty lines and lines starting with "#" are ignored; otherwise each
# line should contain two words. The first word is an orthographic
# sequence (usually a single letter), and the second is a phoneme
# symbol.

# The orthographic symbols are consumed greedily, with the longest
# string of characteres winning. For example the word "ataata" will
# result in the symbols "A T AA T A", not "A T A A T A", while "kai"
# becomes "K AI", not "K A I".

# ei and eu:
# Harlow (A Māori reference grammar, Huia 2015, p.9) lists both as diphthongs
# Peter Keegan in http://www.maorilanguage.info/mao_phon_desc1.html (at 2017-12-12)
# lists neither.
#
# In personal correspondence, Keegan says
# "ei & ēi are diphthongs, but not eu, I’ll correct that page, thanks".
#
# let's go with corrected Keegan.
